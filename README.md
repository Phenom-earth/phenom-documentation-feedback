# Phenom App - Documentation Feedback and Requests

**Welcome!** üëã

This repository is a **public space** for communication about the documentation for the Phenom mobile application. It is used by our internal team, external development partners, and potentially the public in the future.

**Please Read Carefully:** The actual source code for the Phenom app and its core documentation lives in **private** repositories. You cannot see that source code here.

## üéØ What is this Repository For?

Use this repository **only** for these things related to Phenom App documentation:

1.  **Ask for New Documentation:** If you believe documentation is missing for a specific feature, API, process, or concept related to the Phenom app.
2.  **Report Errors in Documentation You Can Access:** If you find a mistake, unclear information, or broken links in any Phenom documentation website or guide provided to you.
3.  **Ask Questions about Existing Documentation:** If something in the Phenom documentation you have access to is confusing and you need clarification.

## üìù How to Submit Your Request or Report
